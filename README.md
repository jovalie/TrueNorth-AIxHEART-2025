## Poetry Setup

Create a local virtual environment with Poetry using
```
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
```
Then, `cd` into the directory that contains pyproject.toml and poetry.lock. Install the poetry environment with this terminal command:
```
poetry install
```
Now you can update your virtual environment that Poetry made:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## Environment Setup
You need an `.env` file with these values set up:
```
export GEMINI_API_KEY="something"
export DEFAULT_GOOGLE_PROJECT="something"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=us-central1
...
```

...check out `.env.example` for a file you can copy.

# Setup
## 1. Preprocess & Embed  PDFs

Before running the chatbot, convert your PDFs into searchable vector embeddings:

```python Knowledge.py```

This process may take 20+ minutes depending on the number and size of PDFs. Data is uploaded to the PostgreSQL vectorstore (pgvector).


## 2. Launch Chatbot API (FastAPI)

Start the backend server (runs on port 8000):

`poetry run uvicorn truenorth.app:app --reload`

### API Docs

Once running, access the API docs and test endpoints at:

```http://localhost:8000/docs```

This Swagger UI lets you test Streamlit UI programmatically and inspect endpoint responses.

## 3. Launch the Streamlit UI

In a separate terminal, start the frontend (runs on port 8501):

```streamlit run streamlit_ui.py```

Then go to your browser:

`http://localhost:8501`

This interface connects to the API and provides an interactive chatbot experience.

## 4. Evaluation Workflows
TrueNorth implements a comprehensive evaluation framework with 14 distinct metrics organized into two categories:

### Conversational Agent (Statkus et al., 2024)

- **Anthropomorphism** - Human-like interaction quality
- **Attractivity** - Visual appeal and engagement
- **Identification** - User relatability and connection
- **Goal Facilitation** - Support for user objectives
- **Trustworthiness** - Reliability and credibility
- **Usefulness** - Practical value and helpfulness
- **Accessibility** - Ease of access and interaction

Meta-Requirements for Individualized STEM Support:

- **MR1**: Gender-Conscious Engagement - Avoids stereotypes, fosters gender diversity respect
- **MR2**: Empathic Intuition - Emotionally aware and naturally caring responses
- **MR3**: Personal Visual Engagement - Personalized context and interactive elements
- **MR4**: Credibility & Relatability - Reliable information delivered in relatable tone
- **MR5**: Inclusive Community - Encourages belonging in diverse environments
- **MR6**: User Agency - Empowers autonomous decision-making
- **MR7**: Cognitive Simplicity - Reduces information processing complexity

Run full evaluation:

`python src/design_evaluator.py`

Outputs are saved to:

`agentic_evaluation_results.csv`

Each row shows binary scores for each design quality.

# Makefile Usage

If `make` is installed, you can simplify operations with:

🔧 Local setup (no Docker)

```
make install        # Install dependencies using Poetry
make embed          # Preprocess PDFs into vector DB
make api            # Launch FastAPI backend (http://localhost:8000)
make ui             # Launch Streamlit frontend (http://localhost:8501)
make test           # Run chatbot API tests using predefined test cases and similarity matric
make eval           # Run evaluation metrics for features Anthropomorphism, Attractivity, Identification, Goal Facilitation, Trustworthiness, Usefulness, Accessibility
```
